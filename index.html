                <h3> Jubilee Austen Project </h3>
                <p> My first project was creating a site for ficticious new developer Jubilee Austen. During a Skillcrush course I built a one page static site from a Photoshop design comp.</p>
                <p><span>Tools Used:</span> Adobe Photoshop | HTML5 | CSS | Visual Studio Code | Google Fonts | W3C HTML & CSS Validation. </p> 
                <p><span>Highlight</span>: Learning new technologies (VSC) and skills (floating)! It gave me a sense of wonder (like a child jumping in a puddle for the first time). In the end the clean and organized code filled me with satisfaction and sparked further curiosity of tech. </p>
                <p><span>Challenge</span>: Learning the tools and technologies above took quite a while. Each time I "jumped in a puddle" I wanted to stay there for hours and just learn.</p>

                <h3> Rogue Pickings Website </h3>
                <p> Tasked with translating a Photoshop design comp for a food truck business into HTML & CSS I focused on honing my boarders and floating skills. </p>
                <p><span>Tools Used:</span> Adobe Photoshop | HTML5 | CSS | Visual Studio Code | Google Fonts | W3C HTML & CSS Validation. </p>
                <p><span>Highlight:</span> New learning is always exciting for me - the box model specifically this time around. </p>
                <p><span>Challenge:</span> Focusing on borders and floats was challenging in that I had to deepen my understanding of the box model and how each one interacts. This required lots of Googling and article reading.</p>

                <h3> My first personal project! </h3>
                <p> I had a lot of fun using the Jubilee Austen project as a template to create my first personal site. </p>
                <p><span>Tools Used:</span> Bluehost | Adobe Photoshop | HTML5 | CSS | Visual Studio Code | W3C HTML & CSS Validation.</p>
                <p><span>Highlights:</span> Navigating Bluehost | Learning FTP | Editing a personal photo into the hero image </p>
                <p><span>Challenges:</span> I really wanted to make this a responsive site - I jumped in and did what I could - until I realized I need to learn mroe before going full tilt responive. I also had some trouble with boxes & floating. </p>
